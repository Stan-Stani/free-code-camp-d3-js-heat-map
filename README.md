# D3.js Heat Map

This heat-map allows the user to
* hover over specific cells for more information
* toggle between 3 color palettes
* toggle between the default quantize scale and a quantile scale

In addition to the map's cell's changing, the legend dynamically changes to represent the user selections.

## Tooltip

The Tooltip is implemented by means of a JavaScript class and is written to be
easily reuseable in other D3 projects.
